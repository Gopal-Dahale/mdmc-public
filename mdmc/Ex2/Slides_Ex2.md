# Exercise 2 - Intro & Tips

Today we'll be building a tool to compute the probability distribution of the energy of a system using Boltzmann statistics. The focus of the exercise is to refresh your notions of statistical mechanics, which will be always the fundations for the simulatio tecniques we'll see during the course.

**Tips!**

- The theoretical part is about statistical thermodynamics. Be sure to know what we mean by
  - Thermodynamic ensembles
  - Microstate 
  - Partition function and why its utility
  - Boltzmann distribution

# Exercise 2 - Intro & Tips

- In the practical part you will build a computer program to compute the Boltzmann distribution of a fictious harmonic oscillator
- You will be asked to modify the code below modifying given functions to translate into code concepts from statistical mechanics
