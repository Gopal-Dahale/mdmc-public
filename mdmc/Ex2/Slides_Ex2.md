# Exercise General Information
- Interviews 
    - 10-15 minues discussion to test your understanding of the exercise
    - Good occasion to discuss your doubts and questions
- Report feedback
    - After your interview, you will get a detailed feedback via Moodle
        - No grade
        - Overall comment and detailed correction of the exercises
  
**Exercises contribute to 1/2 of final grade! We count the best 5 out of the 6 reports for your exercise grade.**

# Notebooks reminder

- Always access the notebooks via  the rocket button on the top right of the code files and choose JupyterHub to launch [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch/) 
- **Make sure to access noto this way each time you begin the exercise to ensure you have the latest version!**

# Exercise 2 - Intro & Tips

Today we'll be building a tool to compute the probability distribution of the energy of a system using Boltzmann statistics. The focus of the exercise is to refresh your notions of statistical mechanics, which will be always the fundations for the simulatio tecniques we'll see during the course.

**Tips!**

- The theoretical part is about statistical thermodynamics.  \
  Be sure to know what we mean by
  - Thermodynamic ensembles
  - Microstate 
  - Partition function and why its utility
  - Boltzmann distribution

# Exercise 2 - Intro & Tips

- The practical part is about computing the Boltzmann distribution of a fictious harmonic oscillator
- Modify the code below to translate into code concepts from statistical mechanics
