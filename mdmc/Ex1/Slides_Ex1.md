# Exercise General Information
- Practical exercises every other week in BCH 1113
    - 2 hours to work on your own and with support from TAs
- Report Submission
    - `pdf` document answering the questions and relevant output
    - Due date is usually the next exercise session (check Moodle!) 
    - Detailed feedback via Moodle after the interview
        - No grade
        - Overall comment and detailed correction of the exercises
- Interviews during next exercise session are about 10-15 minutes
    - Test your understanding of the exercise
    - Good occasion to discuss your doubts and questions
    - We will release the schedule ahead of the session so you know when and with whom you will interview

**Exercises contribute to 1/2 of final grade! We count the best 5 out of the 6 reports for your exercise grade.**

# Resource Platforms

The following resources will be used to access and complete the exercises (more details later):

- [Moodle page](https://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=10441)
    - Access exercise notebook
    - Turn in reports
    - Ask questions on the forum
- [Exercise website: **https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/mdmc-public/**](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/mdmc-public/intro.html)
    - Access jupyter notebooks on Noto
    - Access to public github repository to raise issues for fixes/improvements to the exercises
    - Read theory and questions
- [Noto](https://noto.epfl.ch/)
    - Run and edit code blocks
    - Please note, for the most recent updates to the exercises you must access noto from the exercise website directly

# Computer environment

- We will use a virtual environment that you can directly launch from the [exercise website](https://lcbc-epfl.github.io/mdmc-public/intro.html)
- Click the rocket button on the top right of the code files and choose JupyterHub to launch [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch/) 
- **Make sure to access noto this way each time you begin the exercise to ensure you have the latest version!**

# Computer environment

- On [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch/) your work will be saved on your EPFL storage
- Make sure to always activate (top right) the `Computational Chemistry` kernel

# Jupyter notebooks

- `.iynb` files organized in cells
	- Markdown (text)
	- Code 

- Run a code cell by pressing `Play` button (or `Ctrl`+`Enter`)

# Exercise 1 - Intro & Tips

Today we'll be building a tool to estimate the value of $\pi$ through a random sampling method (akin to Monte Carlo methods). The focus of the exercise is to get a better sense of how we can implement random sampling for numerical integration.

**Tips!**

- There is a small portion linking quantum ideas to classical mechanics. Please let us know if you need additional support regarding the notation/formalisms here.
- It may be a good idea to start from the practical part, to get familiar with the environment and ask us questions
- Places where you need to modify the code blocks should be noted with comments in the code *## Begin code to modify ##*

# Questions ?

Questions outside on the exercises (or the theory) outside exercise hours or problems with the reports? You can always contact us  

- [**Moodle Forum**](https://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/forum/view.php?id=1193419), preferred way of communication since everyone can see the questions (and answer!)
- Email us, always better to include multiple of us to get an answer faster (at least always include Andrea and Sophie)
