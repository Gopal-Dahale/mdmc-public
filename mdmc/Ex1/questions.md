<p class="title">Exercise 1</p>
How do you calculate $\pi$ using the ratio of points that fall within the circle and square? Use a full circle for your computation.
Complete either the Monte Carlo program to calculate $\pi$ using the integration technique . Include the entire
    code within your report or attach as the code files to your submission and comment upon the lines of code that you wrote in the report.

Perform the $\pi$ estimation for 1000, 100,000 and 1,000,000
    trials. Take a screenshot of these estimations and include them in     your report (e.g of the python plots). What happens to the accuracy of the $\pi$ estimation
    when going from 1000 to 1,000,000 trials and why?

What happens if you use the same seed for the pseudo random number generator (PRNG? You can read up more details in {doc}`prng`.  In Python the seed is set using `r.seed()`.

What happens to the estimation of $\pi$ when the circle origin is
    changed? Why?

What happens to the accuracy of the estimation when you increase the
    square size, or decrease the circle size? Is there an optimal ratio?
